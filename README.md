MobilyaPlan app version 1.0


What is MobilyaPlan?
Our project is a platform that meets the customer and the manufacturer. 
Thanks to MobilyaPlan, the customer can make a product he sees on our website (www.mobilyaplan.com) to all members who are members of MobilyaPlan in a comfortable way. 
Apart from other similar sites, MobilyaPlan supports the manufacturer in all aspects of production. 
When the customer arrives at the MobilyaPlan member to get a product he / she sees and likes on the site, the MobilyaPlan member only reaches the G-code of that product in a few operations.
Thus, a product that is seen everywhere on the internet is made CNC. 
This not only reduces production time but also prepares the basis for Industry 4.0.

The MobilyaPlan application provides:

-Customer tracking
-For the members of the furniture, it provides communication with the customer (You can visit www.mobilyaplan.com to become a member of the furniture maker.)
-For customers who want furniture, name, mail, phone number, the type and location of the service they want to get using the nearby FurniturePlan member, allows to communicate.
